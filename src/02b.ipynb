    "Market basket analysis or affinity analysis is the process of identifying patterns and extracting meaningful insight from transaction sets. Association rules are often used for market basket analysis because they allow us to discover, quantify and analyze the co-occurrence of items within a set of transactions. By the end of this tutorial, you will have learned:\n",
